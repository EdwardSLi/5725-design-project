# 5725-design-project
The intuition of this project comes from a desire to take advantage of deep learning more efficiently and innovatively instead of only doing some classification tasks. This idea is motivated by combining two famous deep learning applications on our platform: using face recognition to identify different people and according to the data related to their favorite styles of music, we then use another interesting idea of “generating music of the same style” (one example is like the “deep-jazz” on the GitHub).  The main aspect is to take the camera and use the face-recognition algorithm to identify different people, then use the data stored in the RPi, we can play self-generated music of certain styles (classic, jazz, popular and so on) for different people.
